## Main Sections & Talking Points 

### Climate

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, birds are very important pollinators for wildflowers. In the United States Hummingbirds specifically are amoung the most helpful here and are especially attracted to red. There are 2,000 bird species globally that feed on nectar, insects, and the spiders associated with nectar bearing flowers.

## Saving Bugs

## Beauty
Wildflowers are vibrantly colored by design in order to attact as many pollinators as possible. They have the ability to cover and thrive in our native environment, creating peace and beauty while encouraging gardening and fostering pollinator education.

## Other Ways Of Helping From Your Yard

### Pollinator Houses 
Different types of pollinators require different types of homes and pollinator houses are structures that serve as coazy homes for solitary-nesting native bees. Solitary nesting bees do not live within the protection of colonies and do not produce honey. These bees spend a majority of their time collecting pollen and are more effective pollinateing plants than honeybees. Solitary bees need hollow tubes to to live in for protection and to lay their young, so pollinator houses are a great way to ensure that these little helpers can survive and thrive. 

### Reduce Chemical Usage 

### Plant Milkweed
Milkweed is a famously known host for monarch butterfly catepillars and they attract loads of other insects and birds. Some birds, like the American Goldfinch, use the fiber from this plant to create nests for their chicks.
