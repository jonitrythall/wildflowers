## Main Sections & Talking Points 

### Climate 

#### Water Conservation 

#### Air Pollution Reduction 

#### Less Fertilizer Required 

### Key Pollinators

#### Bees, Butterflies 
Bees and butterflies are the most well known pollinators. They have specialized structures on their bodies that collect pollen and allow them to continusouly carry and transfer this pollen to other plants. 

#### Birds
Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, birds are very important pollinators for wildflowers. In the United States Hummingbirds specifically are amoung the most helpful here and are especially attracted to red. When a hummingbird inserts its beak into a flower to drink the nectar, sticky pollen grains stick to it. The bird then visits another flower and transfers this pollen in the process and if both flowers are the same species pollination occurs.  

There are 2,000 bird species globally that feed on nectar, insects, and the spiders associated with nectar bearing flowers.

#### Beetles
Though often overlooked, Beetles make up the largest group of pollinators because there are so many of them. They are able to see color but choose their favorite flowers based on smell; preferring spicy or spoiled frangrances. Beetles such as ladybugs supply the additional benefit of killing pests that would likely destroy the wildflowers. A single ladybug can eat as many as 5,000 aphids in its lifetime.

#### Moths & Bats!
Pollination is not just a day shift job. Moths and bats take over at night.

While most flower-visiting bats live in more tropical climates, it is still very cool to learn that they can be such important and unexpected pollinators.

## Saving Bugs
Insect populations are decreasing drastically around the world. This is an issue for many reasons other than pollinatoion. Entire ecosystems that rely on bugs as a source of food can die off forever. Insects serve as the base of the food web, eaten by everything from birds to mammals to fish. Without this food source these animals will also die. 

Many insects also do a great job of animal waste removal, carrying out a crucial step in the nutrient cycling process and keeping this wase from literally piling up all around us. 

## Beauty
Wildflowers are vibrantly colored by design in order to attact as many pollinators as possible. They have the ability to cover and thrive in our native environment, creating peace and beauty while encouraging gardening and fostering pollinator education.

## Seeds

### Where To Get Seeds üìç
  * [Urban Farmer Delaware blend](https://www.ufseeds.com/product/delaware-wildflower-seeds/) 
  * [American Meadows northeat blend](https://www.americanmeadows.com/northeast-pollinator-wildflower-seed-mix)

### Growing Seeds

#### Time of Year üìç
Best planted in the spring or fall. When the temperature is below 70¬∞F in the fall the seeds wil remain dormant until spring showers. 

#### Location 

#### Area & Soil Prep 

#### Watering 
Water 2-3 times a week to germinate, then once a month in the growing season if there is not regular rain in the area. 

## Other Ways Of Helping From Your Yard

### Pollinator Houses 
Different types of pollinators require different types of homes and pollinator houses are structures that serve as coazy homes for solitary-nesting native bees. Solitary nesting bees do not live within the protection of colonies and do not produce honey. These bees spend a majority of their time collecting pollen and are more effective pollinateing plants than honeybees. Solitary bees need hollow tubes to to live in for protection and to lay their young, so pollinator houses are a great way to ensure that these little helpers can survive and thrive. 

### Reduce Chemical Usage 

### Plant Milkweed
Milkweed is a famously known host for monarch butterfly catepillars and they attract loads of other insects and birds. Some birds, like the American Goldfinch, use the fiber from this plant to create nests for their chicks.
