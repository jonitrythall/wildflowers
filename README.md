# All About Native Wildflowers 🌷🌻

This is a breakdown of an elementary school presentation topic to be customized and reused. 

It's ideal as a research-based kid/parent science project or an in-class presentation where kids and parents can contribute equally. Having time for these projects can be tricky in our day-to-day lives and in sharing these materials I hope you are able to find stress-free success while learning and teaching a ton in the process. 

Wildflowers contribute to a healthy climate and without our climate there is nothing left. Let's raise a generation of informed, caring individuals that find beauty, excitement, and a sense of wonder and personal responsibility for wildflowers.

I'd really love to see how you make this your own if you want to reach out [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoniTrythall) 👋

Good luck, friends!
